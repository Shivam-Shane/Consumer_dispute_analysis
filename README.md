# Consumer Complaint Analysis

This project contains information about consumer complaints submitted to a financial regulatory agency. The dataset includes the following fields:

● Date received: Date when the complaint was received

● Product: Type of product identified in the complaint, e.g., “Student loan”

● Issue: The issue raised in the complaint, e.g., “Struggling to repay your loan.”

● Submitted via: E.g., “Web” or “Phone.”

● Date sent to the company

● Company response to consumer

● Timely response: Flag specifying if the response was timely

● Consumer disputed: Flag specifying if the consumer disputed the resolution

We have used this dataset to analyze trends in consumer complaints, identify common issues, and assess the effectiveness of companies' responses to complaints.
Here are some examples of what data we can measure from the data

Analyze the most common types of consumer complaints.
Identify the companies that receive the most complaints.
Analyze whether companies are resolving complaints to the satisfaction of consumers.
Most type of issues received from the consumer.
Type of medium used for reporting issues.

When clients find certain aspects of a business dissatisfactory, they typically reach out to customer service to voice their concerns. Despite businesses' efforts to resolve these issues, it's often challenging to fully meet every customer's expectations.

For those interested in predicting consumer disputes, a dedicated model is accessible at https://github.com/Shivam-Shane/Project.
